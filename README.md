## The Park Slope Food Coop Expansion

This is a python script that acts as a basic calculator.

It takes in information about the hours our operation. How many people need to be present each of those hours.

It also takes in info about the possible member population, such as the number of people expected, the percent of missed workslots, the number of average spend of these projected customers per week

Lastly it takes in some simple info about the building total cost and the number of years to pay it back. so like a 10,000 dollar buidling in 20 years.

The infoit returns, tells us if the number of projected memebers can handle the expected workslots needed, it also tells us the amount of extra members, and the weekly revenue. We see if we can pay the building cost and the remainder is left over. This money should be able to cover operational costs. But may not in the first few years as the pay back priority goes towards the building repayment.
